		BALTIMORE – NASA's
		Hubble Space Telescope is offering a glimpse of atmospheric debris
		from an object that plunged into Jupiter in a rare collision with the
		planet. Scientists used the telescope Thursday to capture what they
		call the "sharpest visible-light picture" so far of the expanding
		gash. An amateur stargazer in Australia spotted the impression last
		Sunday. Amy Simon-Miller of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
		Greenbelt, Md., says the magnitude of the impact is believed to be
		rare. Simon-Miller estimates the diameter of the object that hit the
		planet was the size of several football fields. The debris possibly
		came from a comet or asteroid that hit Jupiter. NASA also says the new
		images prove repairs done on the Hubble in May were successful.</p>
