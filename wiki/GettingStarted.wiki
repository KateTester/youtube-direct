==YouTube Direct Getting Started Guide==

  # Register an application instance on Google App Engine (GAE)
    * [http://appengine.google.com/ Sign up for an App Engine account]
    * Permission additional Google Account addresses to be administrators of your App Engine instance. You should permission all users who will need to create assignments and moderate submissions, as well as any email addresses that you would like to use as the `From:` address for mails that App Engine sends.
    * [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/overview.html Read the App Engine Java Overview]
    * (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) Install Eclipse plugin for GAE [http://code.google.com/eclipse/ http://code.google.com/eclipse/]
  # Check out most recent tagged release of YTD project source code. 
    * List of tagged releases at http://code.google.com/p/youtube-direct/source/browse/#svn/tags
    * SVN readonly checkout URL: http://youtube-direct.googlecode.com/svn/tags/YYYYMMDD    
    * Subclipse (http://subclipse.tigris.org/) makes checking out SVN code into Eclipse straight forward, but any SVN client can be used.  
  # Make a copy of war/WEB-INF/appengine-web_DEFAULT.xml and name it war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml. Edit your local copy of the file to: 
    * Replace <application> with your registered App Engine instance name. 
    * Replace <version> with 1, and increment it as you see fit. 
    * Replace com.google.ytd.YTDeveloperKey property with your registered YT Developer Key (get one at [http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/ http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/])
    * Replace com.google.ytd.YTClientID the unique identifier string of your choice.
    * Deploy YTD using the local development webserver environment that comes with the App Engine SDK. If using Eclipse with the GAE plugin, the default "Run" Eclipse action will do this. The webserver runs at *http://localhost:8080/ *.
  # Build and deploy YTD to your application instance on GAE. Be sure that you have completed step 3 and have the correct App Engine instance name in appengine-web.xml!
  # Go to the admin panel for YTD by visiting http://APP_ID.appspot.com/admin, where *APP_ID* is your registered App Engine instance name. You'll need to log in with a Google Account that is set up as an administrator for your App Engine instance.
  # Go to the "Configuration" tab and make the desired configuration changes. Mouse over the ? icons for descriptions of each option.
    * Make sure that the YouTube account you authenticate as is linked to the Google Account that owns your YouTube Developer Key.
  # Go to the "Assignments" tab and create a new assignment.
  # Select the new assignment by highlighting it in the list and click the "Embed Code" button to show the `JavaScript` code to embed the YTD uploader on your page. 
    * Make sure that you modify the ytd-embed.js URL to point to the actual path to the file. *Note: in order to reduce the traffic to your App Engine instance, it's recommended that you host the ytd-embed.js file on your own web infrastructure and reference it from there!*
    * If your page has an existing `window.onload` handler, add the `ytd.embed()` JavaScript code to that instead of creating a new `window.onload`.
  # Visit the "Submissions" tab to view submitted videos and approve/reject them as desired.
    * In the "Configuration" tab, you can specify an address that will receive mail whenever a new video is submitted.
    * Approved videos will be automatically added to a playlist associated with each assignment (owned by your YouTube account), and depending on your configuration settings, will have their descriptions and tags updated to reflect your approval.
  # (OPTIONAL) Register you new App Engine website with Google's AuthSub. This will get rid of the red warning text box that appears when unregistered web sites use AuthSub. There is more information on AuthSub in [http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/AuthSub.html this document]. You can initiate the registration process at https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains
    * When asked for the _Target URL path prefix:_ you should use http://APP_ID.appspot.com/ (where APP_ID is the name of your App Engine instance). Be sure that you use http:// and not https://
    * If you enter an incorrect value for _Target URL path prefix:_ then the AuthSub web interface will reject your requests for AuthSub tokens and will display an error message warning that a malicious web site might be requesting tokens on your behalf.
